Ex03. A discrete random variable X has the following probability distribution:

Compute each of the following quantities.
a. P(X=80) = 0.4 computed directly from the table

b. P(X>80) = P(X= 81)  = 0.1

c. P(X≤80) = P( X = 77) + P(X =78) + P(X =79) + P(X=80)= 0.9
         = 1 - P(X>80) = 1 -0.1 = 0.9

d. The mean μ of X 7777777777777777777777777777777777777777777
      u = Zix1 * P(X= x1) = 77*0.15 + 78*0.15 +... = 79.15

e. The variance σ2 of X
 o2 =  

f. The standard deviation σ


Question 1.
Critically evaluate each of the following terminology (A to H) as regard to web data analytics and describe
the core method of extracting each of these from an ecommerce website like www.amazon.com.
A. Clickstream
B. Dimension
C. Metric
D. Bounce rate
E. Pageview
F. Conversion
G. Goal
H. KPI
Sample Solution
A. Clickstream
Clickstream data captures the customer’s journey from the moment they enter your webpage to the time
they exit. Any event that happened while the visitor is on the webpage are collected by JavaScript
tracker codes placed on each html page. This made it possible to track all the event or how the customer
engaged with the pages. The Java script could track the following events like; video played, downloads,
registration, purchases and many more.
B. Dimension
This are category click stream contents, like the Source of traffic /Channels/Acquisition, devices, search
engine etc. They could be similar to metric; the only difference is that metric are values while
Dimension are categories.
C. Metric
The metrics commonly used to assess the performance of a webpages are contents and industrial
dependent. This are the Click stream that we can measure. Most metrics a in numeric form.
▪ Page View
▪ Bounce/Bounce Rate
▪ Average Session Duration
▪ Dwell Time/Session

D. Bounce rate
This is the rate at which customer enters a web page and leave immediately without doing anything. It
is a significant indication that all is not well with the web page. Why are customer's getting to the page
and just leaving without engaging.
E. Pageview
What is the most popular page that users view, this will enable the owners to optimise the particular
pages, and questions like; what made such pages popular? Can such information be used to improve
other pages? So that other pages could become popular also. How can these popular pages be
commercialised to generate incomes.

F. Conversion
Is when does a visit by a customer to a website led to the customer completing what the website is set
up for. If video watching website, did the visitor convert by watching the video?
If the website is for selling, did the customer convert by buying?
If the website is for registration, did the customer convert by registering?
G. Goal
Goal and KPI are synonymous both are used to assess the performance of the website or pages. While
KPI is a metric of measurement, the goal is threshold metric value. If KPI is downloading a movie. The
Goal 200 people downloading movies per day. If KPI is people registering on your website. The Goal
100 people registering on website per day.
H. KPI
KPI stands for Key Performance Indicators. This a term used to assess the performance of any metric.
What metric should be used to measure the performance of websites? KPI are metrics set by the owners
of the business. For example, it may be a particular value of metric eg downloading a movie in a day
or people registering on your website. It could also be a collection of metrics that must be watched to
know how the website is performing. KPI is a specifics target of measurement that shows that the
website is performing or not.
